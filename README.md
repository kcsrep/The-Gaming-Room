# The-Gaming-Room

The Gaming Room has a game called draw it or lose, in which the players have different drawings rendered to them and they have to guess the drawing before the time expires. The client wanted me to create a web-based version of their game and make it cross platforms. The requirements included making software cross platform while keeping the same design and functionalities, and ensuring that it met the specific operating system requirements. I believe that I did a great job doing research and gathering the necessary information for developing the documentation. Creating the requirements helped me in creating the code. If I could revise a partof the documentation, I would like to revise would be the design constraints, I would improve it by focusing on the major design constraints that would affect the gameplay. I was able to interpret the user's need by prioritizing what the client had asked to of me and ensuring that, ensuring that the client needs are met are imperical becuase it will improve the customer ratings and also increase the chance of the client coming back for future products. I used the Agile approach in designing the software, in the future i plan to use visual aids to help track the flow and progression of my software.
